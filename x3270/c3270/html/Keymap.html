<h1>How to Create a Custom c3270 Keymap</h1>

<h2>It Might Already be Defined</h2>
First, you might want to make sure that the action you want isn't already
defined in the default keymap. The default keymap, documented on the
<a href="c3270-man.html#default-keymap"><b>c3270</b>
manual page</a>, defines common actions using the <b>Control</b> key.
For example, the <b>Reset</b> action, which unlocks the keyboard, is defined
as <b>Control</b>-R.
<h2>Defining a Simple Keymap in <tt>.c3270pro</tt></h2>
If the action you want isn't defined in the default keymap or the <tt>alt</tt>
keymap, then you need to create a custom keymap.
The easiest way to do this is as follows.
Using your favorite editor, create a file called
<tt>.c3270pro</tt>
in your home directory.
In that file, put the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>! Use the 'mine' keymap, defined below
c3270.keymap: mine
! Definition of the 'mine' keymap
c3270.keymap.mine: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Key>PPAGE: PF(7)\n\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Key>NPAGE: PF(8)</pre>
</blockquote>
The first entry (<tt>c3270.keymap</tt>) tells <b>c3270</b> to use the keymap
named <tt>mine</tt>.
The second entry (<tt>c3270.keymap.mine</tt>)
is the definition of the <tt>mine</tt> keymap itself.
<p>Now, run <b>c3270</b>, and do not specify a <b>-keymap</b> option.
The <b>PPAGE</b> key (usually lalbelled <b>Page Up</b>) will now emulate the
3270 <b>PF7</b> key, and the
<b>NPAGE</b> key (usually labelled <b>Page Down</b>) will emulate the 3270
<b>PF8</b> key.
(If you do not have a <b>Page Up</b> or <b>Page Down</b> key, or if these keys
are not properly defined in your <b>terminfo</b> or <b>termcap</b> database,
this will not work, but for most PC-based systems, it will.)
</p>
<h2>Rules for Keymap Definitions</h2>
You may now edit the keymap to create your own custom definition.
Here is the full set of rules.
<ul>
	<li>The first line is always:</li>
	<ul>
		<pre>c3270.keymap.<i>name</i>: \</pre>
	</ul>
	where <i>name</i> is replaced by the name of the keymap you want to
	define.
	(Note the backslash, which <b>must</b> be the last character on the
	line).
	<li>The body (middle) lines always have the format:</li>
	<ul>
		<pre><i>modifier</i> &lt;Key> <i>keyname</i>... : <i>Action</i>(<i>args</i>)\n\</pre>
	</ul>
	where:
	<ul>
		<i>modifier</i> is an optional keyboard modifier such as
		<tt>Ctrl</tt> or <tt>Meta</tt><br>
		<i>keyname</i> is a curses key name: a symbolic name for a key,
		such as <tt>semicolon</tt> (the ';' key) or <tt>BACKSPACE</tt>
		(the Backspace key)<br>
		<i>Action</i> is a <b>c3270</b> action such as <tt>Enter</tt>
		or <tt>PF</tt><br>
		<i>args</i> are the optional action arguments, such as a number
		to specify which PF key to transmit.
	</ul>
	Note that each body line <b>must</b> end with the three
	characters '<tt>\n\</tt>'.
	<li>The last line is the same as the body lines, but <b>must not</b>
	have the '<tt>\n\</tt>' at the end:</li>
	<ul>
		<pre><i>modifier</i> &lt;Key> <i>keyname</i> : <i>Action</i>(<i>args</i>)</pre>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>How to Find the Key Names</h2>
The names for alphanumeric keys are their ISO 8859-1 standard names, e.g.,
<tt>a</tt> for the <tt>A</tt> key, or <tt>semicolon</tt> for the <tt>;</tt>
key.
The list of names for special keys, such as NPAGE, PPAGE and BACKSPACE,
is in the file <tt>/usr/include/ncurses.h</tt>
or <tt>/usr/include/curses.h</tt> on your workstation.
Look for macros starting with the prefix <tt>KEY_</tt>.
<p>
To find out which key name or sequence of key names is being generated for any
given key on your keyboard, start <b>c3270</b> with the <b>-trace</b> option,
and do not connect to a host.
Then press the key(s) in question.
Then exit <b>c3270</b>.
<b>c3270</b> will create the file <tt>/tmp/x3trc.<i>pid</i></tt>.
In that file, several lines of text will be generated for each key you press.
Each entry will begin with the text for the left-hand side of a keymap entry
that will match the key you pressed.
You can cut and paste the text into your keymap definition.

<h2>How to Find the Actions</h2>
These are documented on the <a href="c3270-man.html#actions"><b>c3270</b>
manual page</a>.

<h2>How to Debug Your Keymap</h2>
There are two <b>c3270</b> options to aid with keymap debugging.
The <b>-trace</b> command-line option causes <b>c3270</b> to create a
trace file, <tt>/tmp/x3trc.<i>pid</i></tt>.
That file traces each keyboard and mouse event that <b>c3270</b> processes.
The information traced includes the keymap (and line within the keymap)
that matched the event, the <b>c3270</b> action that was run in response,
and if for some reason the action did not work, why it did not work.
<p>The <b>show keymap</b> command at the <b>c3270></b> prompt
displays the current keymap.
This tells you exactly which keymap entries are active.
Often times it will point out that <b>c3270</b> isn't using the keymap you
thought it was, or that some of your keymap entries
are interfering with one another.
<p>Note that one of the commonest problems in configuring <b>c3270</b>
is figuring out where resources are being defined.
Keymaps are defined
using resources, so this problem can complicate keymap definitions.
<b>c3270</b> resources can be defined in a number of different places:
<ul>

<li>
In the definitions compiled into <b>c3270</b> from the files
<tt>X3270.xad</tt> and <tt>c3270.c</tt>.</li>

<li>
In the file <tt>.c3270pro</tt> in your home directory</li>

<li>
From <b>-xrm</b> command-line options.</li>
</ul>
