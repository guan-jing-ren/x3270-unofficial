<h2>Outstanding Bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>wc3270</b> manual page uses the wrong names for the resources
     used to set the font and font size for the <b>PrintText</b> action.
     The proper names are <b>wc3270.printTextFont</b> and
     <b>wc3270.printTextSize</b> respectively.</li>
    <li><b>wc3270</b> default keyboard mappings that use the <b>Alt</b>
     key and a printable character, such as <b>Alt-p</b> for <b>PrintText</b>
     and <b>Alt-c</b> for <b>Clear</b>, do not always work.
     In particular, they will not be recognized if the Shift key is pressed
     or CapsLock is enabled.</li>
    <li><b>s3270</b>, <b>tcl3270</b> and <b>c3270</b> will not
     build with DBCS support turned off.  The compile will fail at line 788
     of glue.c.  The workaround is to delete that line of code.  Note that
     DBCS support is automatcially turned off in <b>c3270</b>'s <b>configure</b>
     script if it cannot find a wide-curses library.</li>
    <li><b>x3270</b> will not run correctly on a clean installation of Ubuntu
     8.10.  It will complain about not being able to find any colors and
     run in a white-on-black mode.  This is not an <b>x3270</b> bug, it is
     an <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xcolors/+bug/304567">
     Ubuntu bug</a>.  A workaround is to install your own copy of
     <b>/etc/X11/rgb.txt</b>.  A copy is
     <a href="http://x3270.bgp.nu/download/rgb.txt">here</a>.
    <li>The <b>ibm_hosts</b> file is ignored by <b>x3270</b> and
     <b>c3270</b>.</li>
 <li>When <b>wc3270</b> copies DBCS text to the Windows clipboard, it adds
  an extra space character between each pair of DBCS characters.</li>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is disabled.</li>
</ul>
