intro
 <i>Resources</i> are used to configure %p%.  Resources are named items with
 string, integer or Boolean values.
 <p>
 Resource definitions come from the following sources:
 <ul>
 <li>Default values are compiled into %p%.</li>
if x
 <li>Standard X11 methods can be used to override the compiled-in
  defaults.  These methods include:
  <ul>
  <li>The %p% app-defaults file (only if %p% is built with app-defaults
   support).  This can be a locale-specific or generic app-defaults file
   located in the user's home directory or in the system X11 directory.</li>
  <li>Definitions set by the <i>xrdb</i> command.
  <li>The <b>~/.Xdefaults</b> file.
 </ul>
endif
 <li>If a session file <b><i>foo</i>.%p%</b> is specified on the command line,
 its contents are applied.
if x c
 Otherwise, if the %p% profile (<b>~/.%p%pro</b>) exists, it is read and its
 contents are applied.
endif
 These definitions override resource values defined by
if x
 X11 methods and
endif
 compiled-in defaults.</li>
 <li>Command-line options override all other resource definitions.  If more
  than one command-line option sets a resource, the last one is used.</li>
 </ul>
 Many resources have their own command-line switches, which are listed below.
 Those that do not can still be set from the command-line via the <b>-xrm</b>
 command-line option.  For example the %-bsdTm% resource can be set by the
 following command-line option:
 <pre>
     -xrm '%p%.bsdTm: true'
 </pre>
 Note that <b>-xrm</b> is supported on all of the 3270 emulators, not just on
 x3270.

 <h2>Resource File Syntax</h2>
 A resource file
if x
 (app-defaults file, profile or session file)
else
if c
 (profile or session file)
else
 (session file)
endif
endif
 has the following syntax.
 <ul>
  <li>Each definition consists of:
  <pre>
    <b>%p%.</b><i>resource-name</i><b>:</b> <i>value</i>
  </pre></li>
  <li>Comment lines begin with <b>!</b>.</li>
  <li>Line continuation is indicated by a backshash (<b>\</b>) character at
   the end of a line.</li>
if x C
  <li>Multi-line resources, such as keymap definitions, are split with
   newline characters, e.g.:
  <pre>
    <b>%p%.keymap.foo: \
      &lt;Key>a: String("bob") \n\
      &lt;Key>b: String("fred") \n\
      &lt;Key>c: String("joe")</b>
  </pre></li>
endif
 </ul>
.

name acs
applies c
type b
default true
desc
    When true, %p% will use the curses Alternative Character Set (ACS) to
    display box-drawing characters.
    When false, %p% will use Unicode box-drawing characters.
.

name activeIcon
applies x
groups a
type b
default false
switch -activeicon
description
    When true, %p%'s icon becomes a live miniature of the
    screen display.
.

name aidWait
applies x c s tcl
type b
default false
switch -set aidWait
switch -clear aidWait
desc
    When true, %p% will not block a script after executing
    an AID action (<b>Enter</b>, <b>Clear</b>, <b>PF</b> or <b>PA</b>).
    It is then script's responsibility to poll %p%'s status until it shows
    that the keyboard is no longer unlocked.
.

name allBold
applies c
groups a
type s
default auto
switch -allbold
desc
    When true, %p% will display all text in bold.  This is needed
    for terminals like Linux consoles and xterms that display non-bold text
    in unreadably-dim colors.  When false, text will be displayed in normal or
    bold, depending on the host-specified highlighting attribute.
    <p class=indented>
    When set to <b>auto</b>, it will be assumed <b>true</b> for 3279 emulation,
    and <b>false</b> for 3278 emulation.
.

name allowResize
applies x
type b
default true
description
    When true, the %p% window can be resized by the mouse (actually,
    by the
    window manager).  When false, the window can only be resized from
    menu
    options.  The purpose of disabling mouse resizing is to allow a window
    bigger than will fit on the screen, which some window managers (e.g., mwm)
    will not allow if permitted to resize it.
.

name altCursor
applies x
groups a
type b
default false
switch -set altCursor
switch -clear altCursor
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Underline Cursor
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Block Cursor
description
    When true, this causes %p% to use the alternate
    (underscore) cursor.  When false, it will use a block cursor.
.

name altScreen
applies c
type s
switch -altscreen
desc
    Defines a character string that will be output to switch the terminal from
    80-column mode to 132-column mode.
    Within the string, the sequence <b>\E</b> is translated to the ASCII
    ESC character (0x1b).
    <p class=indented>
    When %-model% is 5, and this and
    %-defScreen% are defined, %p% will automatically change the
    terminal size when the host switches between the default (24x80) screen
    and the alternate (27x132) screen.
.

name aplMode
applies x
type b
default false
switch -apl
desc
    Enables %p% APL mode.  APL mode appends <b>apl</b> to the list of names
    in %-keymap% (causing the <b>Alt</b> key plus many alphanumeric keys to
    produce basic APL symbols), sets %-composeMap% to <b>apl</b> (allowing
    <b>Compose</b> key sequences to construct complex APL symbols), and sets
    %-charset% to <b>apl</b> (allowing the display of APL symbols using
    several of the 3270 fonts).
.

name asciiBoxDraw
applies C
type b
default false
desc
    When true, this causes box-drawing characters (the Unicode 2500 block) to
    be drawn with ASCII-art characters (<b>+</b>, <b>-</b> and <b>|</b>).
    This allows a readable representation of these characters on the screen
    when using fonts that do not include them or have them with the wrong
    width.
.

name background
applies x
groups a
type s
default white
switch -bg
switch -rv
description
    The background color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X11 displays, the
    emulator window.
.

name bellVolume
applies x
type i
default 0
description
    Controls the volume used when ringing the terminal bell.  The value
    ranges from -100 (silent) through 0 (normal) to +100 (loud).  Not all
    X11 servers can vary the bell volume, other than turning it on and off.
    This resource can be overridden by %-visualBell%, which
    if true, will replace the bell with a flash of the screen.
.

name blankFill
applies a
groups i
type b
default false
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Blank Fill
switch -set blankFill
switch -clear blankFill
description
    When true, in 3270 mode %p% will automatically convert
    trailing blanks in a field to NULLs in order to insert a character, and will
    automatically convert leading NULLs to blanks so that input data is not
    squeezed to the left.  This works around some of the quirkier behavior of
    real 3270 terminals.
.

name boldColor
applies x
groups a
default green
type s
description
    This resource defines the X11 color used to display intensified text in
    3278 mode.
    <p class=indented>
    Previous versions of %p% implemented something called <i>pseudo-color
    mode</i>, where a monochrome (3278) terminal was emulated with various
    colors assigned to different kinds of fields.
    To emulate pseudo-color mode with the current version of %p%, select 3278
    emulation with %-model%, set %-inputColor% to <b>orange</b> and set
    %-boldColor% to <b>cyan</b>.
.

name bsdTm
applies a
groups p
type b
default false
description
    Defines %p%'s response to the TELNET DO TIMING MARK option.  When set
    to false, %p% will respond to DO TIMING MARK with
    WONT
    TIMING MARK, which is consistent with most modern TELNET clients.  When
    true, %p% will respond with WILL TIMING MARK, which is consistent
    with the old BSD <i>telnet</i> command and with previous versions of
    %p%.  In either case, %p% will never respond to a DONT TIMING MARK option.
.

name cbreak
applies c
type b
default false
switch -cbreak
desc
    If true, %p% will set up the terminal in <b>cbreak</b> mode
    instead of the default <b>raw</b> mode.  <b>Cbreak</b> mode enables
    flow-control processing in the TTY driver, and may be required for
    certain terminals that use flow control to avoid dropping characters.
.

name certFile
applies a
groups s
type s
switch -certfile
desc
    Gives the name of a certificate file, used by the OpenSSL library.
.

name charClass
applies x
type s
desc
    Defines groups of characters that should be treated the same when doing
    cut and paste of words.  Identical in use to the <i>xterm</i> resource
    of the same name.
.

name charset
applies a
groups c
type s
default bracket
switch -charset
option Options -&gt; Character Set
description
    This defines the host EBCDIC character set, that is, what glyph (image) is
    displayed for each EBCDIC code sent by the host, and what EBCDIC code is
    sent to the host for each character typed on the keyboard.
    This is more correctly referred to as the <i>host code page</i>.
    <p class="indented">
    To display the character sets supported by %p%, use the <b>-v</b>
    command-line option.
.

name charsetList
applies x
type s
description
    Defines the <b>Options -&gt; Character Set</b> menu.
    Can contain '<b>&gt;</b>' characters to define a menu hierarchy.
    <p class="indented">
    See the file <b>X3270.xad</b> for an example.
.

name color8
applies a
groups p
type b
default false
description
    If true, %p% will respond to a Query(Color) with a list of 8
    supported colors.  If false, it will send a list
    of 16 colors.  The 8-color setting is required for some hosts which
    abort a session if 16 colors are reported.
if c
    <p class=indented>
    This setting will also cause %p% to assume that the terminal supports
    no more than 8 colors, and will use only the 8 basic curses colors to draw
    the screen.
endif
.

name colorBackground
applies x
groups a
type s
default black
description
    The background color for the emulator window.  This resource is used only
    on color X11 displays when %-model% specifies 3278 mode.  On
    monochrome X11 displays, the background color is <b>white</b>, unless
    <b>-rv</b>
    (reverse video) is selected on the command line; in 3279 mode, the screen
    background is determined by %-colorScheme%.
.

name colorScheme
applies x
groups a
type s
default default
option Options -&gt; Color Scheme
description
    Defines the colors used to paint the emulator window in 3279 (full-color)
    mode.  This resource is used only when %-model% specifies a 3279
    display.
    %-colorScheme% is just the name of the color scheme.
    The actual color scheme definition for color scheme <i>foo</i> is
    %-colorScheme.<i>foo</i>%.
.

name colorScheme.<i>foo</i>
applies x
groups a

description
    The name of the keyboard map to use.
    It can be a single keymap name or a comma-separated list of keymaps,
    which will be applied in order.
    <p class=indented>
    Each keymap can optionally be defined in three separate parts: a common
    keymap, which is applied at all times, an NVT-mode keymap, which is
    applied only in NVT mode, and a 3270-mode keymap, which is only applied
    in 3270 mode.
    The NVT-mode keymap has the same name as the common keymap, with the
    suffix <b>.nvt</b> appended.
    The 3270-mode keymap has the suffix <b>.3270</b> appended.
    Thus specifying a %-keymap% value of <i>foo</i> implies the use of
    three different keymaps (if found): <b>foo</b>, <b>foo.nvt</b> and
    <b>foo.3270</b>.
if x
    <p class=indented>
    After that, the string <b>.user</b>

    for a total of six.
endif
    <p class=indented>
if x
    If no %-keymap% is defined, the environment variables $KEYMAP and

    %-keymap% is only the name; the keymap definition for name
    <i>foo</i> is the resource %-keymap.<i>foo</i>%.

    %-keymap% is only the name; the actual keymap for name
    <i>foo</i> can be defined either by the resource %-keymap.<i>foo</i>%, or

    The keymap file is not searched for in any particular

    finished processing the command, which can cause scripts to malfunction
    subtly.  To avoid this, %p% implements a hack to briefly delay actually
    unlocking the keyboard.
    When %-unlockDelay% is true, the keyboard unlock
