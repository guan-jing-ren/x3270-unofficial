ifelse(XX_PRODUCT,c3270,`XX_SH(Screen Size Switching)
When running as a 3270 Model 5, XX_FB(c3270) can take advantage of terminals
that can switch between 80 and 132 column modes.
XX_LP
Because the curses library does not support mode switching, the escape
sequences and resulting screen dimensions must be specified explicitly to
XX_FB(c3270).
These are specified with the XX_FB(XX_DASHED(altscreen)) and
XX_FB(XX_DASHED(defscreen)) command-line options, or the
XX_FB(altScreen) and XX_FB(defScreen) resources.
XX_FB(XX_DASHED(altscreen)) or XX_FB(altScreen) defines the alternate
(132-column) mode; XX_FB(XX_DASHED(defscreen)) or XX_FB(defScreen) defines the
default (80-column) mode.
XX_LP
The syntax for the options and resources is
XX_FI(rows)`'XX_FB(x)`'XX_FI(cols)`'XX_FB(=)`'XX_FI(init_string),
where XX_FI(rows) and XX_FI(cols) give the screen dimensions, and
XX_FI(init_string) is the escape sequence to transmit to the terminal to
enter that mode.
For XX_FB(defscreen), the minimum dimensions are 24 rows and 80 columns.
For XX_FB(altscreen), the minimum dimensions are 27 rows and 132 columns.
Within XX_FI(init_string), the usual escape sequences are supported
(XX_BACKSLASH(E) for escape, XX_BACKSLASH(r), XX_BACKSLASH(b), etc.).
For example, the init string for a 132-column xterm is:
XX_IP
XX_BACKSLASH(E)[?40h`'XX_BACKSLASH(E)[?3h
XX_LP
Note: When XX_FB(defscreen) and XX_FB(altscreen) are specified, the model
number is always set to 5.

XX_SH(Resources)
